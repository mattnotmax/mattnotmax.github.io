      <description>Hello!
This is the beginning of my digital forensics &amp;amp; incident response blog, bit_of_hex. This blog is born of the philosophy that everyone in the DFIR space has something to contribute, at any level or area within the community.
I also realised that I have benefited for so long from other people&amp;rsquo;s research and effort that it was time I gave something back. Many times when I have searched for that particular forensic artefact or obscure problem I&amp;rsquo;ve found someone who has taken the time to publish their own research.</description>
